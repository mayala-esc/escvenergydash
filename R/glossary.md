**Wholesale spot prices**

The wholesale spot price is the monthly volume-weighted average spot price. The trend is calculated by estimating the seasonally adjusted volume-weighted average spot price using the Seasonal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series method.

**Wholesale futures contract prices**

For a particular month, we calculate the volume-weighted price of base quarterly futures traded during the month. The result is compared with the volume-weighted price during each of the preceding two months.
